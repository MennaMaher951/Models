Multi-Models: From Scratch Implementations
This repository explores four machine learning models implemented from scratch: Lasso Regression, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and SVM Classifier.

Key Highlights:
1. Detailed Implementations: Each model is built from scratch, providing deep understanding of their underlying mechanisms.
2. Comparative Analysis: The models are evaluated on a chosen dataset to compare their performance metrics and identify the best fit for the specific task.
3. Reproducible Steps: Scripts and notebooks included ensure easy replication and further exploration.

Contents:
1. models: Implements each model from scratch with clear documentation.
2. evaluation: Scripts and notebooks for performance comparison and visualization.
3. data: Contains the dataset used for evaluation.

Usage:
1. Modify the data/ folder to use your own dataset.
2. Adapt the evaluation scripts in evaluation/ to fit your specific needs.
3. Explore and modify the model implementations in models/ for deeper understanding.
