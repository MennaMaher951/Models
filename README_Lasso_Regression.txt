Lasso Regression Implementation from Scratch
This repository contains an implementation of Lasso Regression built from scratch in Python using NumPy. It includes functionalities for model fitting and prediction, along with comments and explanations for understanding the algorithm.

Features
Implementations of both model fitting and prediction functionalities.
Utilizes gradient descent algorithm for optimization.
Includes clear comments and explanations within the code.
Easy to understand and modify for further exploration.

Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/lasso-regression-scratch.git
Install dependencies: pip install numpy
Import the Lasso_Regression class from lasso_regression.py.
Create an instance of the class with desired hyperparameters (learning rate, iterations, lambda parameter).
Call the fit method with your training data (features and target variable).
Use the predict method to make predictions on new data.

Example
Python
from lasso_regression import Lasso_Regression

# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.01
no_of_iterations = 1000
lambda_parameter = 0.1

# Load data (replace with your data)
X = ...  # Features
y = ...  # Target variable

# Create and fit the model
model = Lasso_Regression(learning_rate, no_of_iterations, lambda_parameter)
model.fit(X, y)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_new)
Use code with caution.
Further Exploration
Modify the hyperparameters and observe their impact on performance.
Experiment with different datasets and evaluate model accuracy.
Compare this implementation with other Lasso Regression libraries for benchmarking.
