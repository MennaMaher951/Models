Linear Regression Implementation from Scratch
This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression built from scratch in Python using NumPy. It includes functionalities for model fitting, prediction, and visualization, along with comments and explanations for understanding the algorithm.

Features
Implementations of both model fitting and prediction functionalities.
Utilizes gradient descent algorithm for optimization.
Includes clear comments and explanations within the code.
Easy to understand and modify for further exploration.
Demonstrates how to use the model for prediction on new data.
Includes visualization of predicted vs. actual values.

Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/linear-regression-scratch.git
Install dependencies: pip install numpy
Import the Linear_Regression class from linear_regression.py.
Create an instance of the class with desired hyperparameters (learning rate, iterations).
Call the fit method with your training data (features and target variable).
Use the predict method to make predictions on new data.

Example Usage

Python
from linear_regression import Linear_Regression

# Hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.02
no_of_iterations = 1000

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('salary_data.csv')
x = data[['YearsExperience']].values
y = data['Salary'].values

# Train-test split
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=2)

# Create and fit the model
model = Linear_Regression(learning_rate, no_of_iterations)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Make predictions and visualize
test_data_predictions = model.predict(x_test)
visualize_predictions(x_test, y_test, test_data_predictions)
Use code with caution.
Further Exploration
Modify the hyperparameters and observe their impact on performance.
Experiment with different datasets and evaluate model accuracy.
Compare this implementation with other Linear Regression libraries for benchmarking.
